        "Biography":"Perhaps the most famous of the muhaddithat, Aishah bint Abi Bakr was the woman who narrated the highest number of hadith--over 2,000. After the death of her husband, the Prophet ﷺ, she devoted her efforts into teaching the Muslim community, both the sahaba and the younger tabi'een. She used her unique perspective and experience to share details of the Prophet's private life--like how he worshipped behind closed doors and how he treated his family. She also narrated about a wide variety of other topics, like hajj, prayer, eschatology, and rulings in fiqh (jurisprudence). \n\n Most of her teaching was in her home in Madinah, and some when she traveled to Basrah in Iraq. She taught and narrated to several men and women. Aishah taught more than just hadith, often explaining the Quran (tafsir), deriving juristic rulings (fiqh) from the Quran and sunnah, and giving legal opinions (fatwas). Her work helped shape the ways hadith, tafsir, fiqh, fatwas, and general Islamic scholarship was systematized and practiced in later generations of Muslim scholars. For example, one of the Seven Fuqaha (Jurists) of Madinah--the tabi'een (successors) considered to be the largest contributors to hadith transmission and the legal formulations of fatwas--was her nephew Urwah ibn al-Zubayr (the son of Aishah's sister Asma bint Abi Bakr). He developed a close relationship with her, becoming a devoted student and narrating several of her hadiths. \n\n Moreover, many principles of hadith critique and verification that were systematized in subsequent generations of hadith scholars were directly derived from Aishah's methodology. Her holistic approach to hadith critique is recorded in several incidents throughout her life, and it included judging them against the Quran, the Prophet's sunnah (actions and general way of life), other more verifiable and stronger hadiths, the contexts of when the hadith was said, and so on. These would become important considerations as the field of hadith sciences developed in the next few centuries.",

He reassured her saying that Muslim women will be duly rewarded for their deeds just as Muslim men are rewarded for theirs.

Upon hearing this, Asma narrates that she went directly to the Prophet ﷺ, who assured her that both groups of people are honorable migrants with a high status. Satisfied, she went on to narrate this hadith to other migrants from Abyssinia who flocked to her home to hear this hadith directly from her. This shows her strong character as an advocate for herself and her community, without shying away from addressing … or the Prophet ﷺ himself. \n\n Asma bint Umays was recorded by Aishah bint Abi Bakr to have given birth during the hajj, and this incident, along with the Prophet's advice regarding it, is an invaluable source of rulings on women's requirements for hajj in unique circumstances.

As a tabi'yyah, she had never met the Prophet ﷺ, and so she took advantage of her marriage to the companion Abu al-Darda'a to narrate several hadiths from him. She also narrated from Aishah bint Abi Bakr and other male companions.\n\n Umm al-Darda'a often attended the masjid as a child, learning from the teachers there, praying among the men's rows when she was little and then in the women's rows as she grew up. Becoming an adult woman did not restrict her from coming to the masjid--in fact, she taught large classes of both men and women in the mosques of Damascus and Jerusalem. One of the students that sat on the ground of the masjid in Damascus to learn fiqh (jurisprudence) from her was the Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The two developed a close teacher-student relationship, and Umm al-Darda'a often criticized the Caliph whenever he acted unjustly, and he would accept her advice. One recorded incident shows that once, she sat teaching and advising the caliph when the athan was called. As an older woman at that point, she leaned on Abd al-Malik until she reached the prayer place, and then the caliph went ahead to lead the prayer. \n\n In fact, Umm al-Darda'a developed a close relationship with many of her students, and she taught them not just hadith and fiqh but took a holistic approach. She would advise them to be kind and to be conscious of Allah in everything they do, even eating. She was very attentive to her students' manners and etiquette: she showed that hadith transmission was not just about repeating words verbatim, but about showing the sunnah through actions. Umm al-Darda'a's life as a teacher shows the potential that women scholars can reach, and the pedagogical method of teaching not just through words but through actions and embodied knowledge.",
